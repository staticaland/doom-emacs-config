* doom-emacs-config

[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]] is faster than my personal Emacs config. Maybe it is worth to join the team.

** TODO Implement stuff

- Add =marklink= function
- Add programming reformatter hooks
- Treemacs should use =.gitignore= to hide files
- Add =tmux= pane dump function

** TODO Notes

I already found stuff I was about to create in my own config:

- =+tmux/cd-to-here=
- =+tmux/send-region=

So it was already worth the exploration.

I like having =tmux= running in a WM scratchpad.
